      <description>in brief We conduct cutting-edge research developing Bayesian statistical and machine learning methods for the analysis of various types of data including genomic, electronic health, and public health data.
Our lab is founded on collaborations with both accademia and industry, so please contact us.
long form If it has cool math and an impactful question, we are interested. Based on Dr. Silverman&amp;rsquo;s combined medical and statistical training, we tend to gravitate to problems in the analysis of biomedical data; especially, genomics and electronic health data.</description>
