      <description>in brief We conduct cutting-edge research developing Bayesian statistical and machine learning methods for the analysis of various types of data including genomic, electronic health, and public health data.&#xA;Our lab is founded on collaborations with both accademia and industry, please contact us if you are interested in potential collaboration.&#xA;long form If it has cool math and an impactful question, we are interested. Based on Dr. Silverman&amp;rsquo;s combined medical and statistical training, we tend to gravitate to problems in the analysis of biomedical data; especially, genomics and electronic health data.</description>
