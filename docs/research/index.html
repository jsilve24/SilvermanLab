<p>If it has cool math and an impactful question, we are interested. Based on Dr. Silverman&rsquo;s combined medical and statistical training, we tend to gravitate to problems in the analysis of biomedical data; especially, genomics and high-throughput assays. However, our research interests are varied and include both theoretical and applied aspects of mathematics and statistics.</p>
<p>From methodological perspective, we have particular interest in developing robust inferential and predictive models for non-identifiable problems. This includes issues of unmeasured confounding, systematic measurement bias, model misspecification, and scale reliant inference.</p>
