<p>If it has cool math and an impactful question, we are interested. Based on Dr. Silverman&rsquo;s combined medical and statistical training, we tend to gravitate to problems in the analysis of biomedical data; especially, genomics and electronic health data. However, our research interests are varied and include both theoretical and applied aspects of mathematics and statistics.</p>
<h3 id="genomics">Genomics</h3>
<ul>
<li>Statistical methods for the analysis of sequence count data (e.g., 16S microbiome surveys, bulk RNA-seq, and single-cell RNA-seq)</li>
<li>Differential expression and correlation analysis when working with count compositional data. What kinds of assumptions allow these problems to be identifiable?</li>
<li>What do zeros in sequence count data represent and how do we deal with them?</li>
<li>Batch effects and PCR amplification bias</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="electronic-health--personalized-medicine">Electronic Health / Personalized Medicine</h4>

<li>When is there a closed form transformation between two families of probability distributions?</li>
<li>How can you find a transformation that maps one family of probability models into another family (assuming the two families are topologically equivalent)?</li>
<li>Gaussian process with asymmetric kernels</li>
<li>How can you identify families of probability models with identical marginal distributions.</li>
